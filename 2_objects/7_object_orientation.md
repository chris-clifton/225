# Object Orientation
- Object Oriented programming is a pattern that uses objects as the basic building blocks of a program instead of local variables and functions
- Can go further by placing the behaviors that go along with the data in the same object
  - OOP approach puts data and procedures that manipulate data into containers or objects
  - Now dealing with "smart" objects that can perform actions on the data they own
  - This moves complexity inside objects instead of exposing it globally
  - Helps us limit scope of changes so they don't ripple throughout the whole program

- Reducing duplication is not the goal- its a side effect
  - The goal is to make the code easier to understand and make the relationship between it and the data readily evident
  - Questions to ask that are easier to answer:
    - What are the important concepts in the program?
    - What are the properties of an object?
    - How do we create objects?
    - What operations can we perform on an object?
    - Where should we add new properties and methods?

# Objects
- Organize related data and code together
- Are useful when a program needs more than one instance of something
- Become more useful as the codebase size increases
