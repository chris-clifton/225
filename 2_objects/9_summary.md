# Summary
- OOP is a pattern that uses objects to organize code instead of Functions
- Objects can contain data or state
- You can call the property of an object a `method` when the value you assign it is a function
- WHen you invoke an object's methods, they can access the object ot which they belong by using `this`
- Obejcts become more useful as projects become larger and more complicated
