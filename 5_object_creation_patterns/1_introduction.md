# Introduction
- Lesson is a deeper dive into object creation in greater detail

- Unlike other languages, JS doesn't implement behavior sharing using class-based inheritance
- Instead, it uses object prototype to share properties, which is critical to understanding how JS generates individual objects and forms the basis of object-creation patterns that feature behavior sharing

- Start with looking at different ways to generate individual objects, then explore object prototype
- Explore two OOP object generating approaches: classical approach and prototype-based behavior sharing

- JS keyword `instanceof` looks at constructor of an object to let you know where it came from (in classical model, not prototype model)
