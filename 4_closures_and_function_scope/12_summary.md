# Summary

- Closures let a function access any variable that was in scope when the function was defined
- Values that are no longer accessible from anywhere in the code are eligible for garbage collection, which frees up the memory they used for reuse by other parts of the program
- You can use closures to make variables "private" to a function, or set of functions, and inaccessible elsewhere
- Closures allow functions to "carry around" values for later use
- Higher-order functions are functions that take a function as an argument, return a function, or both
